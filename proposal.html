<h2>Introduction to the Project</h2>
<p>Boolean Query is one of the most important types of query in an Information Retrieval System. Lucene has done several optimizations for that. The kernel modular to implement Boolean Query in lucene is <b>Scorer</b>, which can not only score a document, but also provide methods for collecting Hit Documents. There are mainly two Scorers, <b>BooleanScorer</b> and <b>BooleanScorer2</b> (Their natures can be found in <a href='#table1'>Table 1</a>), to deal with Boolean Query on current trunk. The class BooleanQuery would choose one of them as the scorer returning to the its caller.</p>
<p>Today lucene <b>only</b> uses BooleanScorer if the query consists of SHOULD and MUST_NOT. If there is one or more MUST clauses lucene always uses BooleanScorer2. But such way to make the choice is too easy and naive. What I would like to do in this project is to develop a more clever way for BooleanQuery to choose which Scorer to be uses.</p>
<p>The key to implementing the project is to make <b>BooleanScorer</b> support MUST clause, and then check the influence of MUST clause on BooleanScorer's speed by testing.</p>

<div class='dividor'></div>

<h2>Project Goals</h2>
<p>The project shall deliver three components as follows:</p>
<p class=sub1>1) BooleanScorer which supports MUST clause friendly i.e. <b>.advance()</b> should be used trickly to skip docs.</p>
<p class=sub1>2) A better rule for BooleanQuery to choose Scorer.</p>
<!--<p class=sub1>3) A better <b>.rewrite()</b> method in BooleanQuery.</p>-->
<p class=sub1>3) Revelant Javadocs and reports.</p>

<div class='dividor'></div>

<h2>Quantifiable Results for the Apache Community</h2>
<p class=sub1>1) Faster BooleanQuery for lucene.</p>
<!--<p class=sub1>2) More powerful and efficient BooleanScorer which supports .</p>
-->

<h2>Project Details</h2>
<h3>BooleanScorer vs. BooleanScorer2</h3>
Beforing getting down to the optimation, I would like analyze the two Scorers first.
<div class='table_div'>
<div id='table1' class='tag'>Table 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;BooleanScorer vs. BooleanScorer2 on current lucene trunk</div>
<table border='1'>
<tr><th>Scorer</th>
<th>Usability</th><th>Disjunction Query</th><th>Conjunction Query</th>
<th>MUST Clause</th>

<tr><th>BooleanScorer</th>

</div>
<p>Table 1 illustrates some important natures of BooleanScorer and BooleanScorer2 on the current lucene trunk. The great difference between these two Scorer is due to their different ideas on implementation:</p>
<p class=sub1>1) BooleanScorer is implemented by using an array to score windows of 2K. This way can make Disjunction Query faster, but leave the docIDs out of order as result. Thus, BooleanScorer can <b>only</b> be as Top Scorer.</p>
<p class=sub1>2) BooleanScorer2 is implemented in a much more "tranditional" way. That is merging the Disjunction Query with a heap.</p>
<p>In a conclusion, BooleanScorer applies a tricky algorithm to make Disjunction Query faster, but the algorithm makes the BooleanScorer can <b>only</b> be as Top Scorer and unsuitable for Conjunction Query.</p>
<p>As for the Top Scorer only problem, it is not a severe one, because most BooleanQuery does not have deep levels, and the costest Scorer is the Top Scorer. Thus, I prepare to solve the MUST clause.</p>

<h3>Make BooleanScorer Support MUST Clause</h3>
<p>In order to implement this function, the following problem should be solved:</p>
<h4>1) How many MUST clause should BooleanScorer support?</h4>
<div class='h4_content'>
<p>Actually, the original design of BooleanScorer on last trunk can support no more than 32 MUST clauses, if <i>MASK</i> does not extend. Such design is not flexible enough, and may cost a lot on dealing with these clauses one by one.</p>
<p>My idea is to group up all MUST clauses so that it looks like there is just one MUST clause. For example:</p>
<div class='code'><code>
a +b c -d +e f &lt;=&gt; +(+b +e) a c f -d
</code></div>
<p>Apparently, the left part and the right part above are just the same BooleanQuery.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to implementing, there is in fact no need to build a new BooleanClause for the MUST clauses in the query. The most natural way is to pass a new ConjunctionScorer to BooleanScorer. The ConjunctionScorer represents all the MUST clauses in the query, and meanwhile, it looks like only one MUST clause.</p>
</div>

<h4>2) How to collect documents in the method .score()?</h4>
<div class='h4_content'>
<p>In order to collect documents efficiently, docs collected by the ConjunctionScorer should be linked up in the bucket table firstly. After that, the linked list in the bucket table would be a list of docs which satisfy all MUST clauses. <b>ATTENTION</b>: <u>docs' id in the linked list should be in ascending order.</u></p>
<p>Then, by scanning the linked list, subScorers can check the docID and either set its MUST_NOT bit or add one SHOULD hit count to it. In this step, subScorers' .advance() method should be used to skip a lot of docIDs.</p>
<p>At last, a bucket collector can collect all target docs, by scanning the linked list.</p>
<p>A sketch on how to implement procedures above, is as follows:</p>
<div class='code'><code><ol>
<li><b>for each</b> window <b>do</b></li>
<li><div style='margin-left:2em'>Collect docs within the window range to make a linked list on bucket table with ConjunctionScorer;</div></li>
<li><div style='margin-left:2em'>currentDocID = bucketTable.firstDocID;</div></li>
<li><div style='margin-left:2em'><b>for each</b> subScorer <b>do</b></div></li>
<li><div style='margin-left:4em'>subScorer.advance(currentDocID)</div></li>
<li><div style='margin-left:4em'><b>if</b> subScorer.docID() == currentDocID <b>then</b></div></li>
<li><div style='margin-left:6em'>To set MUST_NOT bit or add SHOULD hit count according to subScorer's type;</div></li>
<li><div style='margin-left:4em'><b>endif</b></div></li>
<li><div style='margin-left:2em'><b>endfor</b></div></li>
<li><div style='margin-left:2em'>currentDocID = next(currentDocID);</div></li>
<li><div style='margin-left:2em'>Scan the linked list to collect target docs;</div></li>
<li><b>endfor</b></li>
</ol></code></div>
</div>

<h4>3) Anything else to be careful?</h4>
<div class='h4_content'>
<p>Codes should be specified for the situation where there is no MUST clause in BooleanQuery.</p>
</div>

<h3>Improve the Rule to Choose Scorer</h3>
<p>My intuitive idea is that</p>
<h4>1) Basic setup.</h4>
<h4>2) Get the threshold by testing.</h4>


<!--<h3>Improve .rewrite() in BooleanQuery</h3>
As Only Top Scorer.-->
